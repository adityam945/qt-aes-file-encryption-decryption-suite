Here is the complete workflow from start to finish for securing a folder using your application suite.

Phase 1: Setup (One-Time)
Register Client:

Decryption App: Click "Register". It generates a local private_key.

Action: Sends Public Key + Machine Name to the Encryption Server.

Encryption App: Stores this identity in Encryption_Host.db.

Phase 2: Encryption (On Server/Host)
Encrypt Data (AES):

Input: Source Folder (e.g., /docs).

Process: App generates a random AES Session Key. Encrypts every file in /docs.

Output: An encrypted folder + session_key.txt (Raw Key).

Lock the Key (RSA):

Input: The session_key.txt + Select Target Machine (e.g., "Aditya-Laptop").

Process: App encrypts the AES key using the Laptop's Public Key.

Output: Creates a distribution folder (rsa_ready_...) containing the encrypted files and a session_key.txt.rsa_locked file. The raw key is discarded.

Phase 3: Transfer
Move Files:

Copy the rsa_ready_... folder to the client machine via USB, Cloud, or Network.

Phase 4: Decryption (On Client)
Unlock Key (RSA):

Input: session_key.txt.rsa_locked (from folder) + Local private_key.

Process: App uses Private Key to decrypt the locked file.

Output: Restores the session_key.txt (Raw AES Key) into memory or disk.

Decrypt Data (AES):

Input: The rsa_ready folder + The restored session_key.txt.

Process: App uses the AES key to decrypt every file.

Output: Original folder /docs is restored perfectly.
